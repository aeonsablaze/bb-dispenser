Scads of .SCADS
==================

This is a collections of OpenSCAD based 3d models in varying states
of completeness that I have created at one time or another. Some are
for very specific projects, others are just general utility objects.

Descriptions for individual .scad files can generally be found in a
comment at the top of each file.
